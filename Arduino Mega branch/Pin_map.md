You could probably encapsulate this in a function:
### Usage Example (Analog Pin 0):
Author: Robert

**Initialization:** 

uint16_t output;  
ADCSRA = (1<<ADPS2)|(1<<ADPS1)|(1<<ADPS0); // ADC prescaler = 128  
ADMUX = (1<<REFS0); //use internal Vcc AREF, make sure capacitor is attached to AREF pin  
ADCSRB = 0; //ADC0 source, single conversion mode  
ADCSRA |= (1<<ADEN); //enable ADC  

**Read:** 

ADCSRB &= ~(1<<MUX5); //clear mux5  
ADMUX = (ADMUX&(0xE0))|(0&0x07); //set remaining mux bits  
while(ADCSRA&(1<<ADSC)){} //wait for conversion to finish  
output = ADC;
